I chose a Tic-Tac-Toe game for this project.  After the treehouse lessons, reading articles, 
and wathching many Youtube Videos I realized there were many possibilies with Python.  This game
is in a tradional format of three rows/columns declaring a winner when one of the two players gets
three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  In the rare case of neither player getting three
in a row the game is declared a draw.  There are two printed diagrams of the grid showing the layout for 
moves given to the user, hopefully catching the users attention before the game starts.  

The program covers the following features:
    At least 3 functions returning value
    List of values retreived from program
    A chart that displays and tracks data (Score of TicTacToe games)
    A loop that can continue to run but allows user option to exit
    Invalid user input is programmed to be caught and user told to try different option.

This program was designed for python 3.9 to run.
